# MacBert_Example
This is a MacBert-based model for Chinese text analysis and topic modelling. It uses the Chinese Bert model jointly opened by Harbin Institute of Technology and IFLYTEK CO.LTD. Please refer to https://github.com/ymcui/MacBERTå’Œhttps://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-macbert-large. 
And the framework of the code is heavily borrowed from https://github.com/bbruceyuan/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models-CN. This is the tutorial provided in Chapter 5 of it, where he describes how to use the Bert model. His explanations are excellent, and I recommend his tutorials to native Chinese speakers with initial knowledge about deep learning or text analysis.
The Chinese corpus cases used in the model come from the Chinese Text Classification Corpus of Fudan University https://gitcode.com/open-source-toolkit/283c1. In this case, only ten cases are used in the model. Users can add or replace them with their own corpus as needed.

The final result depends on the size of the data. The examples are as follow:
